## Summary

**Here is your chance to take over Socrates!**

jQuery is a powerful JavaScript library that allows you to manipulate DOM
elements.  One fun way to practice jQuery is to use the console to run jQuery
command on an existing web site and modify its appearance and behavior.

## Releases

Spend 10 minutes on each of the following hacks to the Socrates website, work
with a new pair on each hack.  Enter them in the console to make sure it works
and then save your results in a file which records the results.   For each hack
give the names of the pair working and the jQuery code used to create the hack.
You'll want to reference the [jQuery documentation][].
